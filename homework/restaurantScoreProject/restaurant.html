             The map below displays San Francisco restaurants average risk scores from 2016 to 2018. The inspection was conducted by the SF Health Department. Risk levels, which are based on inspections, are divided in three categories:
             <ol class = 'riskCategory'>
                <li> &nbsp <span class = 'lowRisk'></span> <strong>Low risk (1):</strong> violations that are low risk or have no immediate risk to the public health and safety</li>
                <li> &nbsp <span class = 'modRisk'></span> <strong>Moderate risk (2):</strong> violations that are of a moderate risk to the public health and safety</li>
                <li> &nbsp <span class = 'highRisk'></span> <strong>High risk (3):</strong> violations that directly relate to the transmission of food borne illnesses</li>
                 
             </ol> 

             <!-- Average score -->
             <p>
                Because each restaurant was inspected multiple times from 2016 - 2018, I calculated the average risk score. For each restaurant, the average risk level and score, address, and an example of inspection violation were given.
